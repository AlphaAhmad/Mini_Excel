This project is made on Visual Studio 2022 (community version) which means i have used console (app is console based)
Console settings:
Font:  Raster fint (8x8)
Screen Buffer size:  width = 600 , height = 1006
Window Buffer size:  width = 195 , height = 104 




                 ++(Commands)++
Note: The character commands support caps lock off and on (both)  except for commands with signs like the front slash
But it is recommended that you keep the 'caps lock off'.

- In order to move in the grid you can simply use the arrow keys.
- Command 1: '/' (front slash) for seleting the current cell and then you can add text in the cell 
  Remember you cannot move until you unselect the cell (use / again for unselect).
  and you can only right numbers/floats or alphabets in the cell (A1 is not allowed in cell)
- Command 2: 'I' -> for selecting insertion option, after that select 'C' or 'R'  for column and Row respectively.
  If you have selected columns you will use 'R' for right and 'L' for left, else if you choose row you will use 
  'A' for above and 'B' for below.
- Command 3: 'D' -> for selecting insertion option, after that select 'C' or 'R'  for column and Row respectively.
  This will destoy the current row and column.
Note: The insertion and deletion have a limit like for deletion after 3 rows left row deletion function will not work.
This kind of limit is also on insertion functions
- Command 4: 'C' for going into cell style mode. You will select 'K' for colour option, you will be given 3 options of colour choose one of them
  and colour of cell text will change. To change the allignment of text in the cell choose 'S' instead of 'K' and it will ask you that you want 
  your text to be centered, right ir left.
- Command 5: '1' -> for selecting single cell mode. After that you will have 'D' and 'I' for delete and insert options. In insert you will have to tell
  left 'L', right 'R', above 'A', below 'B', for insertion. Similar for deletion.
- Command 6: 'E' -> to enter erase mode. After that you wil have 2 option 'R' for row and 'C' for columns. This will only erase data of the current row or
  column without deleting its space.
- Command 7: 'm' for going into mouse mode.

Rest i forgot :)
